Problem Statement: 4.3

In a class on 100 students, 80 students passed in all subjects, 10 failed in one subject, 7 failed in two 
subjects and 3 failed in three subjects. Find the probability distribution (PD) of
the variable for number of subjects a student from the given class has failed in.


The PD of failing in 0 subjects, P(X=0) = 0.8

The PD of failing in 1 subjects, P(X=1) = 0.1

The PD of failing in 2 subjects, P(X=2) = 0.07

The PD of failing in 3 subjects, P(X=3) = 0.03
